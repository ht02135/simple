1>generate RSA key <-- github only accept RSA... some tutorial suggest DSA WRONG

cd C:\Users\ht021/.ssh

use dos to generate
ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -C "ht02135@yahoo.com"

The -o flag forces the tool to generate SSH keys with the OpenSSH format.
The -t flag specifies the type of SSH keys to create.
The -C flag allows for comments that get added as metadata at the end of the public key.

these file will be created in C:\Users\ht021/.ssh
id_rsa      <-- it will generate this private key
id_rsa.pub  <-- it will generate this public key

/////////////

2>you need to open id_rsa.pub and copy to github

You will need to paste the contents of your public SSH key into GitHub

/////////////

3>test you can ssh to github from dos
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

/////////////

4>clone remote repo
cd C:\worksplace
git clone https://github.com/ht02135/mygroovy mygroovy
git clone https://github.com/ht02135/simple simple

///////////////

5>Install TortoiseGit 

dont bother with other option...  
TortoiseGit >>>>>>>>>>> all other options
note : i kept getting prompt in eclipse when i do a git pull, even though
       i pointed private key in eclipse preference ssh. wasted time...
	   
git pull/commit via window context menu is way better...
