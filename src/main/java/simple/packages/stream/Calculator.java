/*
If we have Interface with only one abstract method in it, it is by default Functional 
Interface. Can anyone please explain what additional advantage @FunctionalInterface 
annotation brings? 
It's not mandatory to mark the functional interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation, 
the compiler doesn't throw any error. But itâ€™s good practice to use @FunctionalInterface 
annotation to avoid the addition of extra methods accidentally.

	//abstract sum method
	int sum(int num1, int num2); // removed public, by method in interface is public by default
